Wireframing 
 - A wireframe is a collection of sketches and notes that depict a website as it would look on a browser, a tablet, or a mobile device. 
 It shows the layout of the app’s elements, like navigation bars, buttons, content placement, and more—it’s like the blueprint to our app
 - Revise the wireframe 24 hours after first iteration 
 - Practice wireframing by drawing out screens and the different UIs you want to display. 

Step 1 - Screens
 - Self contained user interface devoted to a particular purpose in the app. 
 - IE: amazon, shopping cart and past orders are on separate, screens. 
 - Differentiate between screens
 - Home Screen, Search Screen, Product Details, Cart Screen

Step 2 - Flow
 - Path that a user takes through software
 - Predicts which screens a user will need when clicking something. 
 - Account, Account details, Settings, FAQ, etc

Step 3 - Wireframes
 - Sketches of our apps’ screens in rough approximation to how they will appear in the final product. (iPhone, iPad, watch, etc) and appropriate ratios
 - Lose in appearance, but precise in concepts and design. 
 - A circle can represent a user’s avatar.
 - A box acts as a placeholder for an image, icon, or button.
 - A rectangle can stand for a text area featuring pertinent information.



Creating a new Project in Xcode: - WHAT IS APP PLAYGROUND?
* App: This is the option to choose for most standard apps. It creates a project with a single user interface or view.
* Document App: Choose this option if you expect your app to create documents and share them with other apps. Examples of such apps are text editors and spreadsheets that incorporate a file browser.
* Game: Choose this option if you want to create a gaming app that requires complex graphics.
* Augmented Reality App: Select this option to create an augmented reality app.
* Sticker Pack App: Choose this option to create a project for stickers to be used in the iMessage app. Note that sticker packs are extensions and not apps and can only be used with iMessage.
* iMessage App: This option is used for projects that allow you to create extensions for iMessage or standalone iMessage apps.
* You can also choose to create a framework or library that can be used by different apps. With Xcode, you can create a framework, a static library or a Metal library




SwiftUI:
Views: 
 - The building blocks for the UI of the app.
 - A Scene in an app is made up of Views such as: Text, Image, Label, Button
 - A Protocol: Defines a blueprint of a set of requirements that are needed to accomplish a task
